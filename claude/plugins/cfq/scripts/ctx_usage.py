"""Gate policy: three verdicts, five reasons, three independent off switches.
  - START (gate) / OK (post-phase), reason=none: nothing fired, continue normally.
  - WARN, reason=fiveHour|sevenDay|unknown: advisory only -- the caller decides whether to
    continue. Rate limits (stopFiveHourPct/stopSevenDayPct against the statusline payload's
    five-hour/seven-day usage percentages) and an unresolved context reading (no statusline
    payload, so `used` is empty and nothing is known either way) are budget/visibility concerns,
    not blockers -- continuing works fine.
  - HANDOFF (gate) / STOP (post-phase), reason=capacity: stopUsed against the absolute
    context-token count (input + cache_read + cache_creation). The window fills up whether or
    not the tokens were cheap, so `used` is never weighted by cache share. This is the one real
    blocker -- continuing genuinely does not work.
Precedence: rate limit is checked first, since it is the constraint no later session can work
around -- the context window resets on /clear, the five-hour budget does not -- but a later
capacity hit always wins the reason and escalates the verdict to HANDOFF/STOP: a full window
must never be downgraded to a warning just because a rate-limit reason happened to be evaluated
first. Both reasons still appear in the note when that happens.
The cache share (fresh/creation/read split) is display only and never enters a verdict --
current_usage is a snapshot of the last API call, so the ratio swings after a /clear or a cache
miss without anything being wrong; it is shown so a human can weigh whether attaching another
phase to a warm session is worth it.
Runtime discovery (statusline payload, transcript parsing) lives in cfq_runtime.py; this script
only consumes its `context` subcommand's `used`/`cache`/`rateLimits` fields.
Used by implement-for-queue after each finished phase, and in `gate` mode before a phase starts.

Ported from ctx-usage.sh -- a port, not a redesign: the CLI contract (verbs, argument order, text
output, exit codes) is the invariant this file preserves.
